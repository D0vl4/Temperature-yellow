Hello! üëãüèª

I had a great time coding this project! It was really exciting to learn about how to fetch data from an API and use it to display information in my web application.

Through this project, I gained a lot of experience working with JavaScript, especially when it comes to using async/await and working with JSON data.

One of the most interesting aspects of this project was learning about how to display the temperature information. I enjoyed experimenting with different ways of formatting and rounding the temperature data to make it look clean and user-friendly.

Overall, this was a really fun and rewarding project, and I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish. I'm excited to keep learning more about web development and continue building my skills in the future!
